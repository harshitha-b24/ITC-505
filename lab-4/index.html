        <h2>Email Sync</h2>
        <p>This connector syncs emails (sent and received) in your Outlook/Gmail with your LeadSquared account.
            It posts emails between your users (sales reps) and leads as activities against existing leads. When you
            send or receive an email from a contact that doesn’t exist in LeadSquared, the connector creates them as
            new leads in your account. All of this ensures you can view important emails in your LeadSquared account,
            without having to navigate between different apps.</p>

        <h2>Universal Lead Capture</h2>
        <p>The Universal Lead Capture Connector (ULC) captures leads from popular third-party platforms (99acres,
            Unbounce, CommonFloor, Sulekha, etc.). In addition, it also enables you to build your own integrations to
            capture leads from custom data sources.</p>

        <h2>Calendar Sync</h2>
        <p>This connector is similar to email sync, but the only difference is that here we sync the calendar of
            connected users' accounts instead of their mails and create tasks in Lsq platform.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p><strong>Octus Ocr - Octus SDK</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mar 2021 – Sep 2021</strong></p>
        <p>Octus SDK uses advanced deep learning technologies for accurate and fast ID scanning and OCR. Businesses
            can integrate the Octus SDK into native Android Apps which comes with pre-built screens and configurations.
            The SDK returns the scanned images, extracted data, and error codes. And as a security measure, the SDK
            does not store any of the personal data or ID images that are scanned.</p>

<h3>Addendum Narrative</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Font Choices:</strong> In making font selections, I prioritized readability and aesthetics. The main body text is presented in Arial, a clean and widely recognized sans-serif font, enhancing overall legibility. Headings, on the other hand, utilize a bold sans-serif font like Helvetica to ensure prominence and impact.</li>
    <li><strong>Headings and Text Sizes:</strong> To establish a clear hierarchy, I adopted a structured approach to heading sizes, with <code>h1</code> serving as the primary title and <code>h2</code> for section titles. The sizing of main text aims for optimal reading comfort and visual appeal.</li>
    <li><strong>Color Choices:</strong> The color scheme is crafted for a professional and contemporary appearance. The main text adopts a dark gray tone for legibility, while headings exhibit a slightly deeper shade to underscore their significance. Links are styled with a distinct color, drawing attention to interactive elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Margins and Padding:</strong> Deliberate choices in margins and padding contribute to an overall well-organized and aesthetically pleasing layout. The document maintains a minimal margin for a clean appearance, while headings and sections incorporate specific padding to ensure appropriate spacing and visual balance.</li>
</ul>
