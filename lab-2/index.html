        <h2>Email Sync</h2>
        <p>This connector syncs emails (sent and received) in your Outlook/Gmail with your LeadSquared account.
            It posts emails between your users (sales reps) and leads as activities against existing leads. When you
            send or receive an email from a contact that doesn’t exist in LeadSquared, the connector creates them as
            new leads in your account. All of this ensures you can view important emails in your LeadSquared account,
            without having to navigate between different apps.</p>

        <p><strong>Octus Ocr - Octus SDK</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Mar 2021 – Sep 2021</strong></p>
        <p>Octus SDK uses advanced deep learning technologies for accurate and fast ID scanning and OCR. Businesses
            can integrate the Octus SDK into native Android Apps which comes with pre-built screens and configurations.
